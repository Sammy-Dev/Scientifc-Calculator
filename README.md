# Scientifc-Calculator
This project is a web-based calculator with notable functionality and unique design.<br>
I decided to include in the calculator a few usefull scientific features such trigonometric math, logarithms, pi, bracketing, square roots, and percentages giving it more functionality than many simple web based calculators.<br>
In addition to this, the calculator has a Night mode toggle for individuals such as myself who prefer a darker theme.<br>
This application is responsively designed so it retains full functionality on mobile and desktop.<br>
